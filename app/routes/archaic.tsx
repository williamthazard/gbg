          We cannot know his legendary <NavLink to="/">head</NavLink> <br />
          with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso <br />
          is still suffused with brilliance from inside, <br />
          like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low, <br /><br />
          gleams in all its power. Otherwise <br />
          the curved breast could not <NavLink to="/frogs">dazzle</NavLink> you so, nor could <br />
          a smile run through the placid hips and thighs <br />
          to that dark center where procreation flared. <br /><br />
          Otherwise this stone would seem defaced <br />
          beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders <br />
          and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur: <br /><br />
          would not, from all the borders of itself, <br />
          burst like a star: for here there is no place <br />
          that does not see you. You must change your <NavLink to="/dash">life</NavLink>.
